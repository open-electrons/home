Currently, it consists of the following high level projects:\nocpp-scala\nThis project aims to capture and abstract the messages and data types around the ocpp protocol. It also attempts to define and group the request and response based on the sender and receiver which could either be a Charging Station (CS) or a Charging Station Management System (CSMS). Have a look here for the projectâ€™s source code repository. Have a look here for the latest releases and packages. Please note that only the OCPP protocol version 2.0.1 is supported.\nocpp-example-server\nThis project serves as a reference implementation by using the ocpp-scala project as a library. It defines and abstracts the Websocket implementation as laid out by the OCPP specification. This should represent the behavior of a CSMS to which several CS might connect.

Hello and welcome to the official documentation and wiki of open-electrons\nThe open-electrons project is an attempt to implement the open standards related to EV charging. The OCA alliance defines several protocols for participants in the EV space and, these participants require an ecosystem to communicate with each other to offer the EV driver a seamless experience when it comes to charging his EV car whether on road or when he is at home. Given the new mix of participants consuming electricity on demand, we can build interesting use cases tailored around EV charging which is the aim of open-electrons - To identify and build such use cases.\nHow to find your way around You can start with the Introduction section on the left. This should get you started with some terms and conventions around e-mobility.\nLooking for something else?

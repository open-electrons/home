Hello and welcome to the official documentation and wiki of open-electrons\nThe open-electrons project is an attempt to implement the open standards related to EV charging. The OCA alliance defines several protocols for participants in the EV space and, these participants require an ecosystem to communicate with each other to offer the EV driver a seamless experience when it comes to charging his EV car whether on road or when he is at home. Given the new mix of participants consuming electricity on demand, we can build interesting use cases tailored around EV charging which is the aim of open-electrons - To identify and build such use cases.\nHow to find your way around You can start with the Introduction section on the left. This should get you started with some terms and conventions around e-mobility.\nLooking for something else? If you are interested to know more about open-electrons, please join the discussion\nContributing As always, contributions are very much welcomed.\nYou will find the source code for this entire documentation along with its contents living in a dedicated repository on Github!\nPlease refer the to README there to find yourself around, or file an issue, or maky any changes to this or any of the other pages by clicking the edit button (looks like a pencil) at the top right of this page.! ðŸ˜€\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Wiki","uri":"/home/"},{"content":"","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Categories","uri":"/home/categories/"},{"content":"Contributors Thanks to all the project members and to the individual contributors\nPackages and libraries TODO\nTooling GitHub - Continuous deployment, testing and hosting of this projectâ€™s sources and its documentation Relearn Hugo Theme - The basis layout and styling for this website Hugo - The static site generator of your choice ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Credits","uri":"/home/more/credits/"},{"content":"","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Tags","uri":"/home/tags/"}]

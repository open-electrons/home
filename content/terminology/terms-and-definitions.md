This page contains the terms, definitions and some bit of background information on e-mobility!

**AC** - **A**lternating **C**urrent

Alternating Current (AC) refers to the flow of electrons in a circuit which reverses direction constantly at periodic cycles. 
The flow of electrons in a copper wire is called current. In an AC current, the electrons flow in a certain direction until
it reaches it's peak speed, then starts to slow down, reaches zero and starts to reverse direction until it reaches its
peak again. This is called a cycle, i.e., going from zero to positive peak, getting back to zero, going to negative peak
and then getting back to zero again. How many such cycles occur in a given second is called the frequency, often
measured in Hertz or Hz for short. Here is Europe, we follow the 60 Hz system while in the US, there is a 60 Hz system.

**CS** - **C**harging **S**tation
   
A Charging Station (CS) refers to a physical location that contains one or often times several EV charging units. In analogy
this is similar to a fuel station where there are several fuel pumps. 

**CSMS** - **C**harging **S**tation **M**anagement **S**ystem

A Charging Station Management System (CSMS), as the name implies is a piece of software that is used to manage the Charging
Stations owned by a certain entity. For example., if an entity owns several Charging Stations across a certain geographic
region, it can be easily managed through the deployment of a CSMS software. The OCPP and OCPI specifications make it easy
for handling the standardised communication between a Charging Station and the CSMS software.

**CSO** - **C**harging **S**tation **O**perator

Charging Station Operator (CSO), or a Charging Point Operator (CPO) is an entity that owns and operates one or more charging stations,
and is responsible for technical maintenance, access, power supply and billing. CSO's also ensure that the Charging Stations
installed comply with all the legal requirements in the country / region where the Charging Station is installed.

**DC** - **D**irect **C**urrent

Direct Current (DC) refers to the flow of electrons in a circuit where the flow is only in one direction.

**eMSP** - **eM**obility **S**ervice **P**rovider

An eMobility Service Provider or eMSP or eMobility Provider (EMP) is an entity that offers their customers with access
to multiple charging stations and networks. They are also responsible for the billing, and the settlement process. The eMSP's
pay the CSO / CPO for the charging sessions and later on transact and settle the corresponding invoices with the end
customers.

**EMU** - **E** **M**obility **U**ser

It refers to the end user who typically has an EV car, or an EV truck and would then use the Charging Station to charge 
his car or truck.

**EV** - **E**lectric **V**ehicle

This is the most obvious one as it simply refers to any vehicle that is battery operated and can be charged at a 
Charging Station.

**EVSE** - **E**lectric **V**ehicle **S**upply **E**quipment

**AC** - **A**lternating **C**urrent

Alternating Current (AC) refers to the flow of electrons in a circuit which reverses direction constantly at periodic cycles. 
The flow of electrons in a copper wire is called current. In an AC current, the electrons flow in a certain direction until
it reaches it's peak speed, then starts to slow down, reaches zero and starts to reverse direction until it reaches its
peak again. This is called a cycle, i.e., going from zero to positive peak, getting back to zero, going to negative peak
and then getting back to zero again. How many such cycles occur in a given second is called the frequency, often
measured in Hertz or Hz for short. Here is Europe, we follow the 60 Hz system while in the US, there is a 60 Hz system.

**CSO** - **C**harging **S**tation **O**perator

Charging Station Operator, or a Charging Point Operator is an entity that owns and operates one or more charging stations,
and is responsible for technical maintenance, access, power supply and billing. CSO's also ensure that the Charging Stations
installed comply with all the legal requirements in the country / region where the Charging Station is installed.

**DC** - **D**irect **C**urrent

Direct Current (DC) refers to the flow of electrons in a circuit where the flow is only in one direction.

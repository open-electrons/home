# open-electrons

## Welcome !

Hello and welcome to the official documentation and wiki of open-electrons

The open-electrons project is an attempt to implement the open standards related to EV charging. The OCA 
alliance defines several protocols for participants in the EV space and, these participants require 
an ecosystem to communicate with each other to offer the EV driver a seamless experience when 
it comes to charging his EV car whether on road or when he is at home.

## How to find your way around

You can start with the [**Introduction**]({{<ref "Introduction" >}}) section on the

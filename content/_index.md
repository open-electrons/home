# open-electrons home

The open-electrons project is an attempt to implement the open standards related to EV charging. The OCA alliance defines several
protocols for participants in the EV space and, these participants require an ecosystem to communicate with each other to offer
the EV driver a seamless experience when it comes to charging his EV car whether on road or when he is at home.
